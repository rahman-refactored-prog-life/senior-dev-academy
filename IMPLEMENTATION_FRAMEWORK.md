## **üîÑ SESSION CONTINUITY PROTOCOL**

### **Session Start Checklist**
1. **Read Documentation Files** (in this exact order):
   - `PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete project scope
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_FRAMEWORK.md` - This file with current phase
   - `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Exact session state and continuation point
   - `PROJECT_CONVERSATION_LOG.md` - Recent session history

2. **Verify Current State**:
   - Check git status for uncommitted changes
   - Verify application status (running/stopped)
   - Review last completed tasks and progress percentages
   - Identify exact continuation point

3. **Validate Environment**:
   - Confirm Java 21 and Maven setup
   - Check database connectivity (H2/PostgreSQL)
   - Verify frontend build status
   - Test application accessibility

### **Session End Protocol**
1. **Update Documentation**:
   - `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Update exact session state and next actions
   - `PROJECT_CONVERSATION_LOG.md` - Add session summary and accomplishments
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_FRAMEWORK.md` - Update phase progress and completion status
   - `PROJECT_SCOPE_AND_TRACKING.md` - Mark completed tasks and update metrics

2. **Git Commit**:
   - Stage all modified files
   - Create descriptive commit message with progress summary
   - Include next session continuation point
   - Push to remote repository

3. **Quality Validation**:
   - Verify all code compiles and runs
   - Test implemented features for functionality
   - Validate documentation accuracy and completeness
   - Confirm session continuity information is preserved

### **Progress Tracking System**
- **Phase Completion**: Checkbox tracking with percentage progress
- **Time Estimates**: Realistic duration based on complexity and scope
