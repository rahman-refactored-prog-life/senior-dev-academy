# Clean Rebuild with SDLC Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a clean, production-ready learning portal in a new project directory while preserving valuable content from the existing project. The new system will implement comprehensive SDLC practices with quality gates, automated testing, and proper CI/CD principles.

## Glossary

- **Learning_Portal_System**: The new clean learning portal application
- **Content_Preservation_System**: The mechanism to extract and preserve valuable content from the existing project
- **Quality_Gate_System**: Automated validation and testing mechanisms at each development milestone
- **SDLC_Framework**: Software Development Life Cycle practices including testing, documentation, and validation
- **PostgreSQL_Database**: The production database system (devportal database already created)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Structure and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean project structure in a new directory, so that I can build a maintainable system without technical debt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL be created in a new project directory separate from the existing project
2. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL use Spring Boot 3.2.0 with Java 21 as the backend framework
3. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL use React 18 with Vite as the frontend framework
4. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL use PostgreSQL as the only database (no H2 dependency)
5. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL connect to the existing 'devportal' PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 2: Content Preservation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want all valuable Node.js content and styling preserved, so that previous work is not lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Content_Preservation_System SHALL extract all Node.js topics (25 topics) from the existing DataInitializer
2. THE Content_Preservation_System SHALL preserve all 700+ Node.js interview questions with company attributions
3. THE Content_Preservation_System SHALL preserve all AWS-inspired styling and design components
4. THE Content_Preservation_System SHALL preserve all React components and context providers
5. THE Content_Preservation_System SHALL create structured content files for easy integration into the new system

### Requirement 3: SDLC Implementation

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive SDLC practices implemented, so that the project maintains high quality and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SDLC_Framework SHALL implement automated testing at every development milestone
2. THE SDLC_Framework SHALL include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
3. THE SDLC_Framework SHALL implement Git hooks for pre-commit validation
4. THE SDLC_Framework SHALL include code quality gates (compilation, linting, formatting)
5. THE SDLC_Framework SHALL implement continuous integration with automated builds

### Requirement 4: Quality Gates and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want automated quality checks at each milestone, so that no broken code is committed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Quality_Gate_System SHALL validate code compilation before any commit
2. THE Quality_Gate_System SHALL run all tests before allowing milestone completion
3. THE Quality_Gate_System SHALL check code formatting and linting standards
4. THE Quality_Gate_System SHALL validate database connectivity and schema integrity
5. THE Quality_Gate_System SHALL ensure all endpoints return expected responses

### Requirement 5: Milestone-Based Development

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear milestones with validation checkpoints, so that progress is measurable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL be developed in discrete, testable milestones
2. WHEN a milestone is completed, THE Quality_Gate_System SHALL validate all functionality
3. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL not proceed to the next milestone until all tests pass
4. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL maintain rollback capability to the previous working milestone
5. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL document each milestone with clear success criteria

### Requirement 6: Database Integration

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want proper PostgreSQL integration with schema management, so that data persistence is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL connect exclusively to PostgreSQL database
2. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL implement proper JPA entity relationships
3. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL include database migration scripts for schema changes
4. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL implement connection pooling and transaction management
5. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL include database health checks and monitoring

### Requirement 7: Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want comprehensive testing at all levels, so that system reliability is guaranteed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL include unit tests for all service and repository classes
2. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL include integration tests for all REST endpoints
3. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL include frontend component tests for all React components
4. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL include end-to-end tests for critical user workflows
5. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL maintain minimum 80% code coverage

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want comprehensive documentation and automated updates, so that the system remains maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL include comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
2. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL include developer setup and deployment guides
3. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL automatically update documentation with code changes
4. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL include troubleshooting guides and common issues
5. THE Learning_Portal_System SHALL maintain architectural decision records (ADRs)
