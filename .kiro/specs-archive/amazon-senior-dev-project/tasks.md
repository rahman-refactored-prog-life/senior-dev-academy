## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. **Infrastructure Setup** → **Core Services** → **Advanced Features** → **Production Deployment**
2. **Security Implementation** runs parallel to all development phases
3. **Testing and Quality Assurance** integrated throughout development
4. **Monitoring and Observability** implemented incrementally

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Frontend development can start after API contracts are defined
