# Specs-Based Development Enforcement

## Mandatory Development Methodology

This project has been transformed from vibe-based to systematic specs-based development to prevent context loss, technical debt accumulation, and ensure consistent progress toward the world's most comprehensive FAANG senior developer preparation platform.

## Core Principles

### 1. Specs-First Development
- **NO CODE WITHOUT SPECS**: Every feature must have a complete spec (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) before implementation
- **Requirements-Driven**: All development decisions must trace back to specific requirements in EARS format
- **Design-Validated**: Technical approach must be documented and approved before coding
- **Task-Granular**: Implementation must follow specific, testable tasks with clear acceptance criteria

### 2. Fundamentals-First Approach
- **NEVER SKIP BASICS**: Advanced topics can only be implemented after fundamentals are complete
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each topic must build on previously mastered concepts
- **Beginner-Friendly**: All content must include real-world analogies and zero-experience explanations
- **Validation Required**: Every fundamental concept must be tested and validated before progression

### 3. Zero Context Loss Protocol
- **Complete Documentation**: Every session must update all tracking files
- **Bulletproof Continuity**: Multiple redundancy layers prevent information loss
- **Session Validation**: No session ends without proper context preservation
- **Recovery Procedures**: Systematic methods for reconstructing lost context

## Mandatory Spec Structure

### Requirements Document (requirements.md)
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Requirements

## Introduction
[Clear problem statement and scope]

## Glossary
- **System_Name**: [Definition with underscores for EARS compliance]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: [Clear Requirement Title]
**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit].

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. THE System_Name SHALL [specific behavior]
2. WHEN [trigger], THE System_Name SHALL [response]
3. WHILE [condition], THE System_Name SHALL [behavior]
4. IF [unwanted event], THEN THE System_Name SHALL [response]
5. WHERE [option], THE System_Name SHALL [behavior]
```

### Design Document (design.md)
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Design

## Overview
[Technical approach and architecture]

## Architecture
[System diagrams and component relationships]

## Components and Interfaces
[Detailed technical specifications]

## Data Models
[Database schemas and data structures]

## Implementation Strategy
[Phase-by-phase development approach]

## Error Handling
[Comprehensive error scenarios and responses]

## Testing Strategy
[Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing plans]

## Success Metrics
[Measurable outcomes and performance targets]
```

### Tasks Document (tasks.md)
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

## Task List

- [ ] 1. [Major Task Category]
  - [Clear objective and deliverables]
  - [Specific technical requirements]
  - _Requirements: [Reference to requirements]_

- [ ] 1.1 [Specific Implementation Task]
  - [Detailed implementation steps]
  - [Validation criteria]
  - [Testing requirements]
  - _Requirements: [Specific requirement references]_
```

## Enforcement Rules

### Pre-Implementation Validation
1. **Spec Completeness Check**: All three spec files must exist and be complete
2. **Requirements Validation**: All requirements must follow EARS patterns
3. **Design Approval**: Technical approach must be sound and feasible
4. **Task Granularity**: Tasks must be specific, testable, and time-bounded

### Implementation Validation
1. **Task-by-Task Progress**: Only implement one task at a time
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Each task must meet all specified criteria
3. **Code Quality**: All code must compile, execute, and pass tests
4. **Documentation Updates**: Progress must be reflected in all tracking files

### Session End Validation
1. **Context Preservation**: All session work must be documented
2. **Progress Accuracy**: Documented progress must match actual implementation
3. **Continuation Planning**: Next session must have clear starting point
4. **Quality Assurance**: All deliverables must meet quality standards

## Critical Success Factors

### From COMPLETE_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md Analysis
1. **Realistic Progress Tracking**: Actual ~15% complete, not claimed 85%
2. **Technical Debt Prevention**: Systematic resolution of compilation and runtime issues
3. **Fundamentals-First Content**: Start with basic concepts, not advanced topics
4. **Zero-Experience Support**: Real-world analogies and beginner-friendly explanations

### Automation Requirements
1. **Session Continuity**: Bulletproof context preservation between sessions
2. **Progress Validation**: Automated verification of documented vs actual progress
3. **Quality Gates**: Compilation, testing, and documentation validation
4. **Context Recovery**: Systematic procedures for reconstructing lost information

## Spec Creation Workflow

### 1. Requirements Phase
- Analyze user needs and project scope
- Create user stories with clear benefits
- Write acceptance criteria in EARS format
- Define system boundaries and constraints
- Get user approval before proceeding

### 2. Design Phase
- Create technical architecture and approach
- Define component interfaces and data models
- Plan implementation strategy and phases
- Design error handling and testing approach
- Validate technical feasibility

### 3. Tasks Phase
- Break design into granular, testable tasks
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Establish task dependencies and ordering
- Estimate time and complexity
- Create validation and testing requirements

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Follow tasks sequentially without deviation
- Validate each task completion against criteria
- Update progress tracking in real-time
- Maintain code quality and testing standards
- Document all decisions and changes

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards
- All code must compile without errors or warnings
- All code must execute successfully with expected outputs
- All code must include appropriate error handling
- All code must follow consistent formatting and naming conventions
- All code must include comprehensive comments and documentation

### Documentation Standards
- All specs must be complete and accurate
- All progress tracking must reflect actual implementation
- All session work must be documented in conversation logs
- All technical decisions must be recorded with rationale
- All context must be preserved for seamless session continuation

### Testing Standards
- All functionality must be tested before task completion
- All tests must pass before marking tasks as complete
- All edge cases and error conditions must be tested
- All performance requirements must be validated
- All user acceptance criteria must be verified

## Violation Consequences

### Spec Violations
- **No Spec**: Implementation cannot proceed without complete spec
- **Incomplete Spec**: Must complete all three documents before coding
- **Non-EARS Requirements**: Requirements must be rewritten in proper format
- **Unapproved Design**: Technical approach must be validated before implementation

### Implementation Violations
- **Task Skipping**: Must complete tasks in specified order
- **Quality Failures**: Must fix all compilation, testing, or documentation issues
- **Context Loss**: Must restore complete context before proceeding
- **Progress Inaccuracy**: Must correct all progress tracking discrepancies

## Success Metrics

### Spec Quality Metrics

- **Design Feasibility**: 100% technically sound approaches
- **Task Granularity**: 100% specific, testable tasks
- **User Approval**: 100% stakeholder sign-off before implementation

### Implementation Quality Metrics

- **Test Passage**: 100% test success rate
- **Documentation Accuracy**: 100% alignment with actual implementation
- **Context Preservation**: 100% successful session continuations

### Project Success Metrics
