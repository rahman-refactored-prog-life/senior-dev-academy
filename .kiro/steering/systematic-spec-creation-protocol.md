# üéØ SYSTEMATIC SPEC CREATION PROTOCOL

## COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE FOR AMAZON SENIOR SDE LEARNING PORTAL DEVELOPMENT

This steering document serves as the definitive reference point for systematic spec creation, eliminating the need to re-explain the entire context in future sessions. This document is automatically read by the session startup hooks and provides complete context for continuing spec development.

## üìã **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

### **Mission Statement**
Build **THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE LEARNING PORTAL IN THE WORLD** for Amazon Senior SDE preparation, covering complete zero-to-expert mastery across all technical domains with 8000+ FAANG interview questions and enterprise-grade development standards.

### **Core Objective**
Create a single source of truth that makes Amazon L5/L6 Senior SDE interviews "a cake walk" through:
- Ultra-comprehensive content coverage with Amazon-specific context
- 8000+ real interview questions with Amazon Leadership Principles integration
- Interactive learning environment with AWS-style cognitive-friendly design
- Enterprise-grade development with early AWS deployment

### **‚ùå REMAINING SPECS TO CREATE (19/33 - 58%)**
15-33. **19 additional specs** need complete creation (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)

## üöÄ **SYSTEMATIC CREATION APPROACH (PROVEN EFFICIENT)**

### **Phase 1: Complete Partial Specs First (CURRENT PRIORITY)**
**Rationale**: Most efficient approach - finish what we started before creating new specs
**Status**: Currently executing this phase

**Immediate Next Actions**:
1. Complete **Algorithms Complete Mastery** tasks.md
2. Complete **FAANG Questions Database** design.md and tasks.md
3. Complete **Monaco Code Editor Integration** design.md and tasks.md
4. Complete **Amazon Leadership Principles Mastery** design.md and tasks.md
5. Complete remaining partial specs

### **Phase 2: Create Remaining Specs Systematically**
**Approach**: Create all remaining 19 specs with complete requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md
**Order**: Follow Amazon-standard implementation sequence from MASTER_SPEC_PLAN.md

## üìê **MANDATORY SPEC CREATION STANDARDS**

### **1. EARS Format Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
Every requirements.md MUST follow EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax):
- **Ubiquitous**: THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **Event-driven**: WHEN <trigger>, THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **State-driven**: WHILE <condition>, THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **Unwanted event**: IF <condition>, THEN THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **Optional feature**: WHERE <option>, THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **Complex**: [WHERE] [WHILE] [WHEN/IF] THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>

### **2. Amazon-Specific Requirements Integration (MANDATORY)**
Every spec MUST include:
- **Amazon L3-L6 competency alignment** throughout all requirements
- **Amazon Leadership Principles integration** in technical scenarios
- **Amazon-scale examples** and real-world context
- **Amazon interview preparation** with L5/L6 focus
- **Amazon cultural context** and enterprise standards
- **Amazon hiring bar standards** and performance requirements

### **3. Enterprise-Grade Development Standards (REQUIRED)**
Every spec MUST demonstrate:
- **Requirements-driven development** with EARS compliance
- **Test-driven development** with comprehensive coverage
- **Security-first implementation** following OWASP guidelines
- **Performance optimization** built into every component
- **Comprehensive testing** including unit, integration, E2E
- **Quality gates** and validation systems
- **Monitoring and observability** with enterprise standards

### **4. Complete Spec Structure (MANDATORY)**
Every spec MUST have three files:
- **requirements.md**: EARS-compliant requirements with Amazon integration
- **design.md**: Enterprise-grade technical architecture and implementation strategy
- **tasks.md**: Detailed implementation tasks with dependencies and success criteria

- [ ] EARS format compliance verified for all requirements
- [ ] Amazon-specific context authentic and relevant throughout
- [ ] Enterprise-grade development standards maintained
- [ ] Task dependencies and success criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Cross-references between files validated and consistent

## üìä **PROGRESS TRACKING AND METRICS**
