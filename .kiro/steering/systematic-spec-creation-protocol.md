### **‚ùå REMAINING SPECS TO CREATE (17/33 - 52%)**
14-33. **20 additional specs** need complete creation (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)

## üöÄ **SYSTEMATIC CREATION APPROACH (PROVEN EFFICIENT)**

### **Phase 1: Complete Partial Specs First (‚úÖ COMPLETED)**
**Rationale**: Most efficient approach - finish what we started before creating new specs
**Status**: ‚úÖ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE - ALL PARTIAL SPECS FINISHED**

**‚úÖ Completed Actions**:
1. ‚úÖ Complete **Algorithms Complete Mastery** tasks.md
2. ‚úÖ Complete **FAANG Questions Database** design.md and tasks.md
3. ‚úÖ Complete **Monaco Code Editor Integration** design.md and tasks.md
4. ‚úÖ Complete **Amazon Leadership Principles Mastery** design.md and tasks.md
5. ‚úÖ Complete **System Design Complete Coverage** requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md

### **Phase 2: Create Remaining Specs Systematically (üîÑ CURRENT PRIORITY)**
**Approach**: Create all remaining 20 specs with complete requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md
**Order**: Follow Amazon-standard implementation sequence from MASTER_SPEC_PLAN.md
**Status**: Currently executing this phase

**üéØ Next Priority Specs to Create**:
1. **Database Systems Complete Spec** (Phase 4 - Database & Storage Systems)
2. **AWS Cloud Practitioner Complete** (Phase 5 - AWS Triple Certification)
3. **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** (Phase 5 - AWS Triple Certification)
4. **Dual Question Organization System** (Phase 6 - Interview Preparation)
5. **Rich Note-Taking System** (Phase 7 - Interactive Features)

## üìê **MANDATORY SPEC CREATION STANDARDS**

### **1. EARS Format Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
Every requirements.md MUST follow EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax):
- **Ubiquitous**: THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **Event-driven**: WHEN <trigger>, THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **State-driven**: WHILE <condition>, THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **Unwanted event**: IF <condition>, THEN THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **Optional feature**: WHERE <option>, THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>
- **Complex**: [WHERE] [WHILE] [WHEN/IF] THE <System_Name> SHALL <response>

### **2. Amazon-Specific Requirements Integration (MANDATORY)**
Every spec MUST include:
- **Amazon L3-L6 competency alignment** throughout all requirements
- **Amazon Leadership Principles integration** in technical scenarios
- **Amazon-scale examples** and real-world context
- **Amazon interview preparation** with L5/L6 focus
- **Amazon cultural context** and enterprise standards
- **Amazon hiring bar standards** and performance requirements

### **3. Enterprise-Grade Development Standards (REQUIRED)**
Every spec MUST demonstrate:
- **Requirements-driven development** with EARS compliance
- **Test-driven development** with comprehensive coverage
- **Security-first implementation** following OWASP guidelines
- **Performance optimization** built into every component
- **Comprehensive testing** including unit, integration, E2E
- **Quality gates** and validation systems
- **Monitoring and observability** with enterprise standards

### **4. Complete Spec Structure (MANDATORY)**
Every spec MUST have three files:
- **requirements.md**: EARS-compliant requirements with Amazon integration
- **design.md**: Enterprise-grade technical architecture and implementation strategy
- **tasks.md**: Detailed implementation tasks with dependencies and success criteria
