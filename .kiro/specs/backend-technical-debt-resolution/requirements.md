# Backend Technical Debt Resolution Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for resolving all backend technical debt, compilation issues, and establishing a bulletproof technical foundation that enables seamless development of the comprehensive learning portal for FAANG senior developer preparation.

## Glossary

- **Technical_Debt_Resolution_System**: The systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and resolving all technical debt items
- **Compilation_Validation_Engine**: The automated system that ensures all code compiles successfully across all environments
- **Lombok_Integration_Manager**: The component responsible for proper Lombok annotation processing and compatibility
- **Database_Schema_Validator**: The system that ensures database schema integrity and proper entity relationships
- **Code_Quality_Enforcer**: The automated system that maintains code quality standards and prevents regression

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Compilation Success

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Java code to compile successfully without any errors or warnings, so that I can focus on feature development rather than troubleshooting compilation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Compilation_Validation_Engine SHALL ensure all Java source files compile successfully with zero errors and zero warnings
2. WHEN Maven build is executed, THE Compilation_Validation_Engine SHALL complete the build process in under 60 seconds with success status
3. THE Compilation_Validation_Engine SHALL validate that all Lombok annotations are processed correctly and generate expected methods
4. THE Compilation_Validation_Engine SHALL ensure Spring Boot application starts successfully and reaches ready state within 30 seconds
5. IF compilation fails, THEN THE Compilation_Validation_Engine SHALL provide detailed error messages with specific file locations and resolution steps

### Requirement 2: Lombok Integration Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer using Lombok annotations, I want all Lombok features to work correctly across all development environments, so that I can use modern Java development practices without compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lombok_Integration_Manager SHALL ensure Lombok annotation processing works correctly with Java 21 and Maven build system
2. THE Lombok_Integration_Manager SHALL validate that all @Data, @Entity, @NoArgsConstructor, and @AllArgsConstructor annotations generate expected methods
3. THE Lombok_Integration_Manager SHALL ensure IDE integration works correctly with proper code completion and error detection
4. THE Lombok_Integration_Manager SHALL validate that Lombok-generated code is compatible with JPA and Spring Boot frameworks
5. WHERE Lombok conflicts exist, THE Lombok_Integration_Manager SHALL provide alternative implementations or configuration adjustments

### Requirement 3: Database Schema Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer working with JPA entities, I want the database schema to be consistent and all entity relationships to work correctly, so that data operations are reliable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Database_Schema_Validator SHALL ensure all JPA entities have proper field mappings and annotations
2. THE Database_Schema_Validator SHALL validate that all entity relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany) are correctly configured
3. THE Database_Schema_Validator SHALL ensure database schema creation completes successfully without constraint violations
4. THE Database_Schema_Validator SHALL validate that all repository methods execute successfully with expected results
5. THE Database_Schema_Validator SHALL ensure data initialization completes without foreign key constraint errors

### Requirement 4: Spring Boot Application Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Spring Boot application to start reliably and serve requests consistently, so that I can develop and test features without application stability concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE application SHALL start successfully on port 3002 with all endpoints accessible within 30 seconds
2. THE application SHALL serve static frontend content correctly with proper MIME types and caching headers
3. THE application SHALL handle API requests with proper error handling and response formatting
4. THE application SHALL maintain stable operation for extended periods without memory leaks or performance degradation
5. WHERE application errors occur, THE application SHALL provide detailed logging with stack traces and context information

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Standards Enforcement

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining code quality, I want automated enforcement of coding standards and best practices, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Code_Quality_Enforcer SHALL validate that all code follows consistent formatting and naming conventions
2. THE Code_Quality_Enforcer SHALL ensure all public methods have proper JavaDoc documentation
3. THE Code_Quality_Enforcer SHALL validate that all exception handling follows best practices with proper logging
4. THE Code_Quality_Enforcer SHALL ensure all database operations use proper transaction management
5. THE Code_Quality_Enforcer SHALL validate that all REST endpoints follow RESTful design principles with proper HTTP status codes

### Requirement 6: Development Environment Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer working across different environments, I want consistent behavior and configuration, so that development, testing, and production environments work identically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL provide consistent behavior across development (H2) and production (PostgreSQL) database configurations
2. THE system SHALL ensure all environment-specific configurations are externalized and properly documented
3. THE system SHALL validate that all dependencies are compatible across different Java versions and operating systems
4. THE system SHALL provide clear setup instructions that work consistently across different development machines
5. WHERE environment differences exist, THE system SHALL provide clear documentation of differences and configuration requirements

### Requirement 7: Automated Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code reliability, I want comprehensive automated testing that validates all functionality, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL provide unit tests for all service layer methods with at least 80% code coverage
2. THE system SHALL provide integration tests for all REST endpoints with comprehensive scenario coverage
3. THE system SHALL provide database integration tests that validate entity relationships and data operations
4. THE system SHALL execute all tests successfully in under 5 minutes with clear pass/fail reporting
5. THE system SHALL provide automated test execution as part of the build process with failure prevention for broken code

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer building a comprehensive learning platform, I want the technical foundation to support high performance and scalability, so that the system can handle thousands of concurrent users effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent API requests with response times under 200ms
2. THE system SHALL implement proper database connection pooling with configurable pool sizes
3. THE system SHALL provide caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data with configurable TTL
4. THE system SHALL implement proper logging with configurable levels and structured output
5. THE system SHALL provide monitoring endpoints for health checks and performance metrics

### Requirement 9: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining and extending the system, I want comprehensive documentation that explains all technical decisions and implementation details, so that I can understand and modify the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL provide comprehensive API documentation with examples and response schemas
2. THE system SHALL document all configuration options with default values and usage examples
3. THE system SHALL provide troubleshooting guides for common issues with step-by-step resolution procedures
4. THE system SHALL document all architectural decisions with rationale and alternative considerations
5. THE system SHALL maintain up-to-date README files with accurate setup and usage instructions
