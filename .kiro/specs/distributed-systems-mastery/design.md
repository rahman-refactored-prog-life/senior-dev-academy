# Distributed Systems Mastery - Design Document

## Overview
This design implements a comprehensive distributed systems learning module with interactive simulations, hands-on coding exercises, and Amazon-specific examples to prepare candidates for Senior SDE roles.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **CAP Theorem Simulator**: Interactive tool demonstrating consistency/availability trade-offs
- **Consensus Algorithm Visualizer**: Step-by-step Raft and Paxos implementations
- **Pattern Implementation Lab**: Hands-on coding environment for distributed patterns
- **Amazon Systems Deep Dive**: Detailed exploration of AWS distributed services

### Learning Progression
1. **Fundamentals**: CAP theorem, consistency models, distributed system challenges
2. **Consensus**: Raft and Paxos algorithms with visual demonstrations
3. **Patterns**: Circuit breaker, saga, event sourcing, CQRS implementations
4. **Amazon Systems**: DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, Kinesis architecture analysis
5. **Interview Preparation**: 120+ questions with detailed solutions
