# Distributed Systems Mastery - Requirements Document

## Introduction
This specification defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive distributed systems education covering CAP theorem, consistency patterns, consensus algorithms, and distributed architecture patterns essential for Amazon Senior SDE roles.

## Glossary
- **Distributed_Systems_Portal**: The learning platform component focused on distributed systems concepts
- **Amazon_Scale_Systems**: Large-scale distributed systems used at Amazon (DynamoDB, S3, etc.)
- **Consensus_Algorithms**: Distributed agreement protocols like Raft and Paxos
- **CAP_Theorem**: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance trade-offs

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CAP Theorem and Consistency Models

3. THE Distributed_Systems_Portal SHALL include hands-on exercises with DynamoDB consistency models
4. THE Distributed_Systems_Portal SHALL provide 50+ interview questions on CAP theorem and consistency
5. WHERE Amazon services are discussed, THE Distributed_Systems_Portal SHALL explain their consistency guarantees

### Requirement 2: Consensus Algorithms Implementation
**User Story:** As a Senior SDE candidate, I want to understand consensus algorithms deeply, so that I can design fault-tolerant distributed systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. THE Distributed_Systems_Portal SHALL provide step-by-step Raft algorithm implementation
