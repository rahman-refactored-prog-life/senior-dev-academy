# Microservices Architecture Complete - Requirements Document

## Introduction
This specification defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive microservices architecture education covering service mesh, API gateways, distributed tracing, and Amazon-specific microservices patterns for Senior SDE preparation.

## Glossary
- **Microservices_Portal**: The learning platform component focused on microservices architecture
- **Service_Mesh**: Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication
- **API_Gateway**: Entry point for microservices architecture
- **Amazon_Microservices**: AWS-native microservices patterns and services
