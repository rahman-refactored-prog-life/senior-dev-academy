# REST API & Swagger Implementation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the comprehensive REST API architecture and OpenAPI/Swagger documentation system for the world's most comprehensive FAANG preparation platform. The system shall provide enterprise-grade API design patterns, comprehensive documentation, authentication mechanisms, and scalable API infrastructure that supports the learning portal's backend services.

## Glossary

- **REST_API_System**: The comprehensive RESTful API architecture and implementation
- **Swagger_Documentation_Engine**: The OpenAPI/Swagger documentation and testing interface
- **API_Gateway**: The centralized API management and routing system
- **Authentication_Service**: The JWT-based authentication and authorization system
- **Rate_Limiting_Engine**: The API usage control and throttling system
- **API_Versioning_System**: The backward-compatible API version management system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive REST API Architecture

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a well-designed REST API architecture, so that I can efficiently integrate with backend services using industry-standard patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE REST_API_System SHALL implement all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) with proper semantic usage
2. THE REST_API_System SHALL follow RESTful resource naming conventions with hierarchical URL structures
3. THE REST_API_System SHALL provide consistent JSON response formats with standardized error handling
4. THE REST_API_System SHALL implement proper HTTP status codes for all response scenarios
5. THE REST_API_System SHALL support content negotiation with JSON as primary format

### Requirement 2: OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation System

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive API documentation with interactive testing capabilities, so that I can understand and test API endpoints efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Swagger_Documentation_Engine SHALL generate complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all endpoints
2. THE Swagger_Documentation_Engine SHALL provide interactive API testing interface with request/response examples
3. THE Swagger_Documentation_Engine SHALL include detailed parameter descriptions, data types, and validation rules
4. THE Swagger_Documentation_Engine SHALL document all error responses with example payloads
5. THE Swagger_Documentation_Engine SHALL auto-update documentation when API changes are made

### Requirement 3: Enterprise Authentication & Authorization

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, so that API access is properly controlled and user data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_Service SHALL implement JWT-based authentication with secure token generation
2. THE Authentication_Service SHALL provide role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
3. THE Authentication_Service SHALL support token refresh mechanisms with configurable expiration
4. THE Authentication_Service SHALL implement secure password hashing using bcrypt or equivalent
5. THE Authentication_Service SHALL provide OAuth2 integration for social login capabilities

### Requirement 4: API Rate Limiting & Performance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API rate limiting and performance controls, so that the system remains stable under high load and prevents abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Rate_Limiting_Engine SHALL implement configurable rate limits per user and endpoint
2. THE Rate_Limiting_Engine SHALL provide different rate limit tiers based on user subscription levels
3. THE Rate_Limiting_Engine SHALL return appropriate HTTP 429 responses when limits are exceeded
4. THE REST_API_System SHALL implement response caching for frequently accessed data
5. THE REST_API_System SHALL provide API performance metrics and monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 5: API Versioning & Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an API maintainer, I want proper API versioning strategies, so that I can evolve the API while maintaining backward compatibility for existing clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Versioning_System SHALL support URL path versioning (e.g., /api/v1/, /api/v2/)
2. THE API_Versioning_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility for at least 2 major versions
3. THE API_Versioning_System SHALL provide clear deprecation notices and migration guides
4. THE API_Versioning_System SHALL implement content negotiation versioning as alternative option
5. THE API_Versioning_System SHALL document version differences in Swagger documentation

### Requirement 6: Learning Platform API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a learning platform user, I want comprehensive API endpoints for all learning features, so that I can access content, track progress, and manage my learning journey programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE REST_API_System SHALL provide complete CRUD operations for learning modules and topics
2. THE REST_API_System SHALL implement user progress tracking endpoints with analytics data
3. THE REST_API_System SHALL provide interview question management with filtering and search capabilities
4. THE REST_API_System SHALL implement note-taking endpoints with rich text and code snippet support
5. THE REST_API_System SHALL provide user profile management with preference settings

### Requirement 7: API Security & Data Validation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want robust API security measures and data validation, so that the system is protected against common vulnerabilities and data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE REST_API_System SHALL implement input validation for all request parameters and payloads
2. THE REST_API_System SHALL protect against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
3. THE REST_API_System SHALL implement request/response logging for security auditing
4. THE REST_API_System SHALL use HTTPS for all API communications with proper SSL/TLS configuration
5. THE REST_API_System SHALL implement API key management for third-party integrations

### Requirement 8: API Testing & Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive API testing capabilities, so that I can ensure API reliability, performance, and correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE REST_API_System SHALL include automated unit tests for all endpoint logic
2. THE REST_API_System SHALL provide integration tests for complete API workflows
3. THE REST_API_System SHALL implement contract testing to ensure API specification compliance
4. THE REST_API_System SHALL include performance tests for load and stress testing
