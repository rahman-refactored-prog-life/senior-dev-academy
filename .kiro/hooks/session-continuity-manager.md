# Session Continuity Manager Hook

## Hook Configuration
```yaml
name: "Session Continuity Manager"
trigger: "manual"
description: "Provides complete session state and continuation instructions for seamless pickup"
button_text: "üìã Get Session Continuity Brief"
icon: "üìã"
category: "Session Management"
```

## Hook Purpose
This hook generates a comprehensive session continuity brief that allows new sessions to pick up exactly where the previous session ended, with zero context loss and immediate productivity.

## Execution Instructions

### 1. Read Current Session State
Read and analyze the current project state from key tracking files:
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Exact session state and next actions
- `PROJECT_SCOPE_AND_TRACKING.md` - Progress tracking and completion status
- `PROJECT_CONVERSATION_LOG.md` - Recent session history and decisions
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Technical implementation status

### 2. Analyze Active Development Context
Check the current development environment:
- List any running processes (Spring Boot, frontend servers)
- Verify application status and accessibility
- Check git status for uncommitted changes
- Identify files currently being worked on

### 3. Generate Comprehensive Continuity Brief
Create a detailed brief including:

#### A. Exact Session State
- Last completed phase/task with timestamp
- Current progress percentages
- Files modified in last session
- Any running processes or servers

#### B. Immediate Next Actions
- Specific next task to execute
- Required prerequisites or dependencies
- Estimated time for next milestone
- Priority level and urgency

#### C. Technical Context
- Current Java version and environment setup
- Application status (running/stopped)
- Database state and content status
- Any known issues or blockers

#### D. Node.js Expanded Scope Status
- Current progress on 25-topic curriculum
- Question implementation status (X/700+)
- Project completion status (NASA, Planets, SpaceX, Pong, AWS)
- ZeroToMastery foundation progress
- FAANG Senior enhancement progress

#### E. Development Environment Ready Check
- Verify all required tools and dependencies
- Check application accessibility
- Validate database connectivity
- Confirm frontend/backend integration

### 4. Provide Session Startup Commands
Generate ready-to-execute commands for:
- Starting the application if needed
- Accessing key URLs and interfaces
- Running any required validation checks
- Setting up development environment

### 5. Context Preservation Validation
Ensure all critical information is captured:
- No missing implementation details
- All architectural decisions documented
- Complete progress tracking maintained
- Session continuity guaranteed
