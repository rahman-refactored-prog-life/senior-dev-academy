## Architectural Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Controller Layer**: HTTP request handling and response formatting
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and orchestration
- **Repository Layer**: Data access and persistence
- **Configuration Layer**: Application configuration and setup

### 2. Dependency Injection
- Constructor-based dependency injection for all components
- Interface-based design for testability and flexibility
- Spring Boot auto-configuration where appropriate

### 3. Error Handling
- Global exception handling with consistent error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes for all scenarios
- Detailed error messages for development, sanitized for production

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Database connection pooling and query optimization
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for long-running operations
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection

### 5. Security First
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization for all endpoints
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Security headers and CORS configuration

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- All public methods must have JavaDoc comments
- Complex business logic must be documented inline
- Configuration classes must document all properties
- API endpoints must have Swagger/OpenAPI annotations

### Architectural Decisions
- All significant architectural decisions must be documented as ADRs
- ADRs must include context, decision, and consequences
- Alternative solutions must be considered and documented
- Regular review and updates of architectural decisions

### API Documentation
- All endpoints must have complete Swagger documentation
- Request/response examples must be provided
- Error scenarios must be documented
- Authentication requirements must be clearly stated

## Maintenance

This documentation is maintained by the development team and should be updated whenever:
- New architectural decisions are made
- System components are added or modified
- API endpoints are changed or added
- Deployment procedures are updated
- New troubleshooting procedures are discovered

For questions or updates to this documentation, please contact the development team or create an issue in the project repository.
