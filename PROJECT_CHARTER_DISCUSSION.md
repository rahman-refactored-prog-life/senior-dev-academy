## Complete Conversation Log

### Initial Request
**User**: "what's the next step now - create user stories and break down the whole project into small pieces with regular interval-ed milestones?"

**Kiro Response**: Suggested creating comprehensive Product Backlog with user stories, breaking down into manageable sprints, and establishing regular milestones. Offered choice between Kiro Spec approach vs Traditional Product Backlog.

**User Choice**: "Create as Kiro Spec (specs-based development)"

### Context Discovery Phase
**User**: "can you please read these two files completely for me complete_project_context - ends at line 884, project_scope_and_tracking - ends at line 1076.
